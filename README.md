# Simple lua plugin for [xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp)

This is a simple xournal++ plugin that integrates work from [Ben Smith](https://github.com/ave-63/xournal-keys) and Roland [LÃ¶tscher](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/tree/master/plugins/ColorCycle). I just used their lua setups and added a few key bindings to easily select colors and a couple of shape drawing actions. So, the merit is fully theirs.

To install, follow the instructions at https://xournalpp.github.io/guide/plugins/.
